My solution to exercise "OrganizingAProject-6" from the book "Programming Elixir".
I did not enjoy this exercise at all, but I am showing my solution because someone may find it useful.
This project is not particularily polished but I am going to be done and move on.
A polished version would have tests, be refactored and have a better command line parser.
